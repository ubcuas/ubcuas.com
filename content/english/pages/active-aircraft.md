## Dragonfly

Our newest project and the team's second VTOL project to date. The aircraft is designed to be super modular, allowing for quick and easy payload changes as well as easy disassembly. The team is currently working on Dragonfly to improve its flight performance and capabilities.

## Hummingbird

The Hummingbird Project was the teamâ€™s response to the need for a more precise and quickly configurable aircraft many years ago. The Wasp series of Unmanned Systems allows us to quickly change the payload and layout of the aircraft and fly different style missions within minutes of one another.

As the years have progressed, Hummingbird has retained its strong performance and so it continues to be used as a test drone for software and camera systems.
