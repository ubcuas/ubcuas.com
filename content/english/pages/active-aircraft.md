## Hydrone

Hydrone is the team's flagship aircraft for the 2025 season. With modularity in mind, Hydrone is designed to be versatile -- allowing for quick and easy payload changes as well as easy disassembly.

## Hummingbird

The Hummingbird Project was the teamâ€™s response to the need for a more precise and quickly configurable aircraft many years ago. The Wasp series of Unmanned Systems allows us to quickly change the payload and layout of the aircraft and fly different style missions within minutes of one another.

As the years have progressed, Hummingbird has retained its strong performance and so it continues to be used as a test drone for software and camera systems.
