## Albatross

Albatross was the team's premier aircraft for the 2023-2024 season. Built based on Dragonfly, Albatross is a VTOL aircraft that is designed to be super modular, allowing for quick and easy payload changes as well as easy disassembly. The team is currently working on Albatross to improve its flight performance and capabilities.

Albatross competed in the 2024 AEAC and SUAS competitions. It was able to place 3rd overall at AEAC!

## Hummingbird

The Hummingbird Project was the teamâ€™s response to the need for a more precise and quickly configurable aircraft many years ago. The Wasp series of Unmanned Systems allows us to quickly change the payload and layout of the aircraft and fly different style missions within minutes of one another.

As the years have progressed, Hummingbird has retained its strong performance and so it continues to be used as a test drone for software and camera systems.
