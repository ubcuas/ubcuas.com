{{< accordion title="What is UBC UAS?" class="active" >}}

The University of British Columbia Uncrewed Aircraft Systems engineering student team (UBC UAS) is a multidisciplinary group of students spanning multiple faculties, including Engineering, Forestry, Science and Business. We strive to be at the cutting edge of unmanned aviation technologies, working with industry and government in making use of UAS in a broad spectrum of disciplines and applications.

UBC UAS provides our members with a chance to follow their passion for unmanned aviation and its applications. Positions and projects within the team range from aircraft design to network communications to image processing. Additionally, our team works closely with multiple faculty, industry, and government representatives to provide a wide range of educational and fun experiences for team members. This includes flight training, ground school, and chances to work with professors and research students.

{{< accordion "Is UBC UAS licensed?" >}}

YES! UBC UAS is fully insured and has a number of Advanced class licensed RPAS pilots. We are also fully authorized to conduct flight operations within Vancouver with our registered aircraft and our maintained relations with local Transport Canada and Nav Canada offices allow us to stay up to date with UAV standards and regulations. We’re happy to help advise UBC-affiliated professors and/or groups on Transport Canada licensing and restrictions.

{{< accordion "How can I legally fly my own drones?" >}}

As of June 1, 2019, any aircraft in flight weighing more than 250g requires the pilot to have at least a ‘Basic certificate’ from Transport Canada. Flying within built up areas or near airports requires an ‘Advanced certificate’. Please consult the Transport Canada website or a local drone flight school like [Coastal Drone](https://coastaldrone.co/) or [11alpha](https://11alpha.ca/) for more information.
