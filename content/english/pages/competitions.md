##### **Aerial Evolution Association of Canada (AEAC)**

For the AEAC 2024 competition, the scenario was transporting four passengers within the Big City Urban Area (BCUA) along with cargo, while demonstrating superior performance and the ability to perform 'instrument' approaches to challenging landing sites. The Phase 2 Flight Assessment consisted of two tasks. Task 1 involved a Vehicle Performance Assessment, where the UAS must safely transport the passengers and cargo over a long-distance route, showcasing optimum vehicle performance. Task 2, the Urban All-Weather Landing Trial, required the UAS to perform an instrument approach to a designated landing pad while maintaining contact with Air Traffic Control (ATC).

##### **Student Unmanned Aircraft Systems Competition (SUAS)**

For the SUAS 2024 competition, the mission required the UAS to successfully take off and reach an altitude of 75ft AGL within the first 10 minutes of the mission clock, or face termination. The team was required to follow a waypoint lap immediately after takeoff before attempting other tasks. These other tasks included finding and identifying payload drop off locations, and successfully dropping correctly labeled payloads to their matching targets.
