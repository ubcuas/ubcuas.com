UBC UAS is a great place to get a taste of industry, develop a diverse range of technical skills, network with like-minded individuals, and work on meaningful projects. Every year we design and build new systems from the ground up for our national Aerial Evolution Association of Canada (AEAC) competition and international Student Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS) competition hosted by the RoboNation. We also like to have fun - we treat our design team members like family and host regular socials.

Some languages and tools the team uses: JavaScript, Go, C++, Git, Angular, Python, React, Django, Docker, and Linux. Some developers may work on Payload sub-team projects, which require embedded development skills, including the use of microcontrollers, Git, control systems, telemetry, and more. Knowledge of motor control, control systems, and microcontrollers is an asset. Any knowledge with these tools and languages is a plus. Prior professional software development experience is not required but strongly recommended. Open-source contributions are also a plus.
